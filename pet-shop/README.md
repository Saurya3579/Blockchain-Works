> This decentralized app is made from `truffle framework` documentation.

Steps to use with testrpc:

> Do not forget to manage the ports ...

- Open `testrpc` in one terminal.

- Write code / Complete app.

- `truffle.cmd compile` - generates build folder and equivalent json files.

- `truffle.cmd migrate` - deploys in testnet.

- Copy pneumonics from the console of `testrpc` and paste in seed pass in metamask.

- Run by : `npm run dev` or `lite-server`.

> Happy working.

> If `ganache` is installed/ used then `testrpc` is not required I guess.
